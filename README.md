# Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project uses a **Logistic Regression** model to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on a set of medical attributes. The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

## Dataset

The model is trained and evaluated on the "Heart Disease UCI" dataset. This dataset contains 14 attributes, including age, sex, cholesterol levels, and chest pain type, to predict the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of heart disease.

## Model & Performance

A Logistic Regression classifier was chosen for this binary classification task. After training, the model achieved an accuracy of approximately **85%** on the test set.

The performance is further detailed in the confusion matrix below, which shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions.



This visualization helps in understanding the model's performance in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
